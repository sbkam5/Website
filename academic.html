        <h1>Candy Crush Clone (Java)</h1>
        <h2>University of California, Irvine.  EECS 40</h2>
        <p>This is an android application that is meant to mimic the game candy crush.
          It is a game that features a 9x9 board of five different candy types, and ends when
          players reach a specific score. The application features five different candy types,
          initializes with a completely randomized board, allows for combo scoring,
          and prevents players from inputting illegal moves.</p>

        <h1>Super Mario Clone (Java)</h1>
        <h2>University of California, Irvine.  EECS 40</h2>
        <p>An app that is meant to function as a Super Mario clone. I used multi-threading to
          implement a game loop into the application.  The app included multiple enemies and power-ups,
           all of which were their own class objects and had unique interactions with the player.
           Lastly, I used Rect object methods such as intersect to help account for collision detection
          so that the player could not move through in game objects such as platforms or piranha plant
           pots.</p>

        <h1>Geometry Solver (HTML & Javascript)</h1>
        <h2>University of California, Irvine.  EECS 118</h2>
        <p>This is a web application that was made with jsp files using html and Javascript.
          that is used to solve for two types of geometry problems.  In both problems,
           the geometry solver takes in known inputs from users and calculates for as many
           outputs as possible.  The algorithm of the solver involved a continuous loop that
            solved for particular unknowns.  Those previously unknown values would then be added
           to the list of “known” values, and this loop of solving for unknowns would continue
            until no other unknown value could be solved for.</p>
