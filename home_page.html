      <p style="font-size: 2.2vw" class="skills-p">I am proficient in the coding languages of C, Java, and Python. 
        I also have experience with HTML and Android Studio. 
        I can use multiple tools from Microsoft Office such as Word, PowerPoint, and  Excel, and I have even done 3D modelling in Solid works. 
        Lastly, I posses great team communication skills, leadership experience, and an excellent work ethic.</p>

      <p class="exp-header">Experience</p>
      <p style="font-size: 2.2vw" class="exp-p">Most of my experience comes from academic projects.  Such projects included a chess program, a Super Mario Clone,
        and a Geometry Solver web application.  I have even built two quadcopters and posses two years of robotics experience.
        Additionally, many of these projects gave me experience with working in multiple team environments, and I am
        currently a robotics mentor for the Glen A. wilson robotics team.</p>

        In fact, my interests in games and comics partially helped in inspiring me to pursue a major in Computer Engineering.
        Sometimes, I like to also take it upon myself to pursue various personal projects wherein I design some of my own app game clones.</p>
